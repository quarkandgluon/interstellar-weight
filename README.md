# Weight on Other Planets 🌍✨

This simple C program calculates your weight on different planets in the Solar System based on your Earth weight.

## How it works
- The program asks for your weight on Earth.
- You choose a planet (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune).
- It applies the planet’s gravity factor and prints your weight there.


## Build & Run
### Using GCC (MinGW on Windows)
```bash
gcc scale.c -o scale.exe
./scale.exe
```
### USING MSVC
```bash
cl scale.c
scale.exe
```
